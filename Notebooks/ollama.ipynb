       " 'response': \"The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When the sun shines, it sends out all kinds of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and infrared radiation.\\n2. **Scattering occurs**: As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, so they scatter the shorter wavelengths more efficiently.\\n3. **Blue light is scattered more**: Blue light has a shorter wavelength (around 450-495 nanometers) compared to other colors. As a result, blue light is scattered in all directions by the atmospheric gases and particles, making it reach our eyes from every direction.\\n4. **Our brain perceives the sky as blue**: Since blue light is scattered more than other colors, our brain interprets the combination of all those scattered blue photons as the color of the sky.\\n\\nThis process is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. The scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) than for longer wavelengths (like red and orange), which is why the sky typically appears blue during the daytime.\\n\\nKeep in mind that this explanation simplifies some aspects of atmospheric science. Other factors like dust, water vapor, and pollution can affect the apparent color of the sky, making it appear more hazy or polluted in certain situations.\",\n",
